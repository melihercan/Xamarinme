# Xamarinme
This project provides libraries and plugins for Xamarin applications.
Currently two libraries have been implemented:
* [Xamarinme.Configuration:](Configuration/README.md) Bringing .NET Core Configuration feature into Xamarin. Use appsettings.json file just like in ASP.NET apps to provide configuration parameters to Xamarin apps. [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xamarinme.Configuration) is here.
* [Xamarinme.Hosting:](Hosting/README.md) (WORK IN PROGRESS) Bringing .NET Core Hosting into Xamarin. 
It supports Dependency Injection, Configuration, Logging and Environment features.
